### Inflection

Compared to English, Romanian is an inflected language. This means that the words
of the language are comprised of roots, which rarely change, and inflections,
or endings. Although not all words change form, most of them (nouns, adjectives,
pronouns, verbs) do.

### Cases

Even though Romanian has five cases, namely nominative, accusative, dative,
genitive, and vocative, nominative and accusative, respetively dative and genitive
have the same form.

Below is an example of how a noun forms differ in Romanian but remain the same
in English.

| Case       | English | Romanian          |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| nominative | man     | bărbat            |
| accusative | man     | bărbat            |
| dative     | man     | bărbatului        |
| genitive   | man's   | bărbatului        |
| vocative   | man     | bărbatule/bărbate |
