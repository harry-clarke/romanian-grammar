context, they will help you put everything together.

### Romanian alphabet

Romanian uses an extended Latin alphabet. Compared to the English alphabet, it
has the following five extra letters.

| Letter | English name                                    |
|:------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| Ă      | A-breve                                         |
| Â      | A-circumflex                                    |
| Î      | I-circumflex                                    |
| Ș      | S-comma (not to be confused with Ş - S-cedilla) |
| Ț      | T-comma (not to be confused with Ţ - T-cedilla) |

### Pronunciation

Apart from a few exceptions, Romanian consonants sound virtually identical to
their English counterparts. Vowels, on the other hand, have slightly different
pronunciations using a more relaxed/open mouth.

The following tables will aid you in pronouncing what are most probably the
most unfamiliar sounds to English speakers, yet they are by no means complete.
See [Romanian pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_alphabet)
for a more exhaustive explanation.

#### Vowels

| Sound | IPA phoneme | English example |
|:-----:|:-----------:|-----------------|
| A     | a           | f**a**ther      |
| Ă     | ə           | **a**bove       |
| Â / Î | ɨ           | ros**e**s       |
| I     | i           | cr**ee**d       |
| O     | o           | d**oo**r        |
| U     | u           | l**oo**m        |

#### Consonants

*C* and *G* followed by either *E* or *I* change their sounds.

| Sound   | IPA phoneme | English example |
|:-------:|:-----------:|-----------------|
| C       | k           | **c**ar         |
| Ce / Ci | tʃ          | **ch**alk       |
| Ge / Gi | dʒ          | **g**eneral     |
| J       | ʒ           | expo**s**ure    |
| Ș       | ʃ           | **sh**arp       |
| Ț       | ts          | pi**zz**a       |

### Â or Î

Although *Â* and *Î* sound precisely the same, Romanian use of both letters
stems from etymology. So, by using a simple rule to swap between the two,
Romanian has been able to retain some similarity with Latin, where most
etymons use *A* instead of *Â* and *I* instead of *Î*.

The rule between them is that *Î* is only used at the start and end of a word.
In the middle, you would use *Â*.

* **î**ncepe (to begin) - start
* hotăr**î** (to decide) - end
* mânca (to eat) - middle
* neînfricat (fearless) - here we use *î* because the word stems from *înfricat*
with the preposition *ne*

### Eu, ea, e, este

Although Romanian has exceptionally few pronunciation exception, there is one
which is noticeable from the very beginning. *Eu* (I/me), *el* (he/him), *ea*
(she/her), *ei* (they/them masc.), *ele* (they/them fem.), *e* (is), and *este*
(is) are all pronounced starting with /ie/ instead of simply /e/.

### Personal pronouns

Compared to English, Romanian's personal pronouns lack a precise translation
for *it*. When having a subject that you would normally use *it* for, you
can either use demonstrative pronouns (*acesta* (this masc.), *aceea* (that fem.)
etc.), or simply refrain from using a pronoun.

| English             | Romanian        |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| I                   | eu              |
| you                 | tu              |       
| he / she / it       | el / ea / *N/A* |
| we                  | noi             |
| you (pl.)           | voi             |
| they (masc. / fem.) | ei / ele        |

### To be

In Romanian, the subject of any setence has to be in agreement with the verb
representing the action it is performing. This agreement is called **conjugation**
and comes with its own set of rules and exceptions. Below you will find the
conjugation table for *a fi* (to be).

| English                 | Romanian          |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| I am                    | eu **sunt**       |
| you are                 | tu **eşti**       |       
| he / she is             | el / ea **este**  |
| we are                  | noi **suntem**    |
| you are (pl.)           | voi **sunteţi**   |
| they are (masc. / fem.) | ei / ele **sunt** |
