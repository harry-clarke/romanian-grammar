### Accusative/Objective Nouns

There are two types of accusative noun: *informal* and *formal*
The formal form consists of both the informal and informal pronoun.

#### Informal
This is simply in the form of `subject informal-accusative verb`:
* Subject: `I` -> `Eu`
* Informal accusative: `Her` -> `O`
* Verb: `See` -> `Văd`
* `I see her` -> `Eu o văd`

All informal accusative nouns are pronouns, which means that the proper or common noun is implied; we don't know who we mean when we say "her", so it has to be inferred.

|Person|English|Română|
|-|-|-|
|1st Si.|Myself|Mă|
|1st Pl.|Us|Ne|
|2nd Si.|You|Te|
|2nd Pl.|You|Vă|
|3rd F. Si.|Her/Them|O|
|3rd F. Pl.|Them|Le|
|3rd M. Si.|Him/Them|Îl|
|3rd M. Pl.|Them|Îi|


#### Formal
Formal accusative terms are an extension of the informal.
The `subject informal-accusative verb` part remains the same.
But we then follow it up with a preposition (usually `pe`) and the formal accusative noun: `subject informal-accusative verb preposition formal-accusative`
Together, this looks like:

* Subject: `I` -> `Eu`
* Informal accusative: `Her` -> `O`
* Verb: `See` -> `Văd`
* Preposition: No direct English equivalent -> `Pe`
* `I see her` -> `Eu o văd` (Inf.) *or* `Eu o văd pe ea`

Formal accusative nouns can be either pronouns or proper/common nouns, allowing for us to be explicit:
`Eu o văd pe Maria` -> `I see Maria`
Proper nouns are exactly the same as their objective form:
`Maria este o fată`, `Eu o văd pe Maria`
Common nouns follow the preposition pattern of using the non-articulate form:
`Banana este bună`, `Eu o văd pe banană`
Pronouns are exactly the same as their objective form:
`Ea este o fată`, `Eu o văd pe ea`
