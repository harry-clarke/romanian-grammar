## Ones and Teens

The parts of speech that refer to numbers directly are called
numerals.

Up to the number ten, they have specific names:

| English | Romanian |
|---------|----------|
| zero    | zero     |
| one     | unu      |
| two     | doi      |
| three   | trei     |
| four    | patru    |
| five    | cinci    |
| six     | șase     |
| seven   | șapte    |
| eight   | opt      |
| nine    | nouă     |
| ten     | zece     |

### Numerals up to nineteen

Numerals between eleven and nineteen are formed from the
numbers euqivalent to their last digit and the ending
*sprezece* (*spre zece* means *towards ten*) with a few
small exceptions.

| English   | Romanian          |
|-----------|-------------------|
| eleven    | **un**sprezece    |
| twelve    | **doi**sprezece   |
| thirteen  | **trei**sprezece  |
| fourteen  | **pai**sprezece   |
| fifteen   | **cinci**sprezece |
| sixteen   | **șai**sprezece   |
| seventeen | **șapte**sprezece |
| eighteen  | **opt**sprezece   |
| nineteen  | **nouă**sprezece  |

### 1, 2 and 12

You may have noticed until now that the numerals for 1,
2 and 12 change form. The reason why this happens is
because they have different forms when agreeing with
masculine and feminine nouns in case it is used where
you would normally use an adjective.

For example:

* un bărbat / o femeie (one man / one woman)
* doi bărbați / două femei (two men / two women)

This also applies when using multiples (*sute*, *mii*,
*milioane*) which are all feminine.

| English | Masculine   | Feminine     |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| one     | un          | o            |
| two     | doi         | două         |
| twelve  | doisprezece | douăsprezece |

In case you're wondering why *unu* is missing from the
table above, it's because this particular form is used
only when talking about the mathematic number one or
quantities whose name is not provided. In other words,
*unu* is used only in the case of pure numerals, not
adjectives form from numerals.

* Am doar **unul**. (I have just one.) - numeral
* **Un** om și jumătate. (One and a half men.) - adjective formed from numeral
