# Numbers: Ordinals

Ordinals describe the "place" in an ordered list that something has.</br>
Think of a race; who came first, second, third, etc.?

## Notes
All ordinals are denoted by describing what is "owned" by the number.</br>
Each number uses its definitive form, except for `first` (`primul` (M) or `prima` (F))

## As a description
`The boy is second`: In English, we describe a direct comparison between `the boy` and `second`; they're one and the same.</br>
`Băiatul e al doilea`: In Romanian, we describe the boy as _belonging_ to the number 2.</br>
This can be broken down further as:
* `Băiatul`: `The boy`
* `e al`: `belongs to` (See [Possessive Pronouns](../Pronouns/possessive.md))
* `doilea`: `The [number] two`

## As a noun modifier
`The second boy`: `Al doilea băiat`
