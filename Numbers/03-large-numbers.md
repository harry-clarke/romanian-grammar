## Larger numerals

Apart from the above, all other numerals will be composed
from separate words which are *not* hyphenated. To form
them, you need to remember a few multiples and their plural
forms.

| English  | Romanian | Plural   |
|----------|----------|----------|
| hundred  | sută     | sute     |
| thousand | mie      | mii      |
| million  | milion   | milioane |
| billion  | miliard  | miliarde |

Here are a few examples. It's also common in Romanian to
use the prepositon *de* between multiples (apart from *sută*)
in order to form larger numerals but it is not necessary.

* șaizecișitrei (de) milioane două sute optzecișiuna (de)
mii trei sute paisprezece (63,281,314)
* un milion șapte (1,000,007)
