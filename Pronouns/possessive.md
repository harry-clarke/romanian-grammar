### Possessive pronouns

Like in English, Romanian distinguishes between two types of possessive
pronouns named **relative** and **absolute**.

Relative possessive pronouns are used when only wanting to replace the
owner.

* El e prietenul *meu*. (He is my friend.)

Absolute possessive pronouns, on the other hand, are used instead of the
owner *and* the owned object or person.

* Nu e *al tău*. (It's not yours.)

The absolute form is formed by adding the **possessive article** to the
relative form according to the gender and number of the replaced noun
(neuter nouns are masculine when singular, and feminine when plural):

| Number   | Masculine | Feminine |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Singular | al        | a        |
| Plural   | ai        | ale      |

### Relative possessive pronouns

Relative possessive pronouns change form according to the owner's person
and number, and to the owned object or person's gender and number.

| Owner                 | English | Owned masc. sg. | Owned fem. sg. | Owned masc. pl. | Owned fem. pl. |
|-----------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1st person, sg.       | my      | meu             | mea            | mei             | mele           |
| 2nd person, sg.       | your    | tău             | ta             | tăi             | tale           |
| 3rd person, masc. sg. | his     | său/lui         | sa/lui         | săi/lui         | sale/lui       |
| 3rd person, fem. sg.  | her     | său/ei          | sa/ei          | săi/ei          | sale/ei        |
| 1st person, pl.       | our     | nostru          | noastră        | noștri          | noastre        |
| 2nd person, pl.       | your    | vostru          | voastră        | voștri          | voastre        |
| 3rd person, pl.       | their   | lor             | lor            | lor             | lor            |

### Absolute possessive pronouns

Like in the case of relative possessive pronouns, they change form
according to the owner's person and number, and to the owned object
or person's gender and number, while also adding the possessive
article in front.

| Owner                 | English | Owned masc. sg. | Owned fem. sg. | Owned masc. pl. | Owned fem. pl.   |
|-----------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1st person, sg.       | mine    | **al** meu      | **a** mea      | **ai** mei      | **ale** mele     |
| 2nd person, sg.       | yours   | **al** tău      | **a** ta       | **ai** tăi      | **ale** tale     |
| 3rd person, masc. sg. | his     | **al** său/lui  | **a** sa/lui   | **ai** săi/lui  | **ale** sale/lui |
| 3rd person, fem. sg.  | hers    | **al** său/ei   | **a** sa/ei    | **ai** săi/ei   | **ale** sale/ei  |
| 1st person, pl.       | ours    | **al** nostru   | **a** noastră  | **ai** noștri   | **ale** noastre  |
| 2nd person, pl.       | yours   | **al** vostru   | **a** voastră  | **ai** voștri   | **ale** voastre  |
| 3rd person, pl.       | theirs  | **al** lor      | **a** lor      | **ai** lor      | **ale** lor      |

### Genitive-dative form

Possession can also be expressed by not replacing the owner with a
possessive pronoun and using the noun's genitive-dative form which
is similar to *'s* you would add in English to signal possession.

* Nu găsesc portofelul **lui**. (I can't find **his** wallet.)
* Nu găsesc portofelul **bunicului**. (I can't find **grandfather's** wallet.)

In the example above, we are keeping the owner, **bunicului**,
instead of using a pronoun-originating adjective, **lui**.

*The genitive-dative form is better explained in a further lesson.
The introduction here is only meant to give you a bigger picture
when it comes to possession in Romanian.*
