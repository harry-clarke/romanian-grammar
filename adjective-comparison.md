### Degrees of comparison

Unlike English, Romanian has only one way of comparing adjectives,
and it involes no irrgulars. It does, however, invole some degree
of inflection just like in the case of adjectives.

#### Comparative

| Comparative type | English         | Romanian            |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| of superiority   | more pronounced | mai pronunțat       |
| of inferiority   | less pronounced | mai puțin pronunțat |
| of equality      | as pronounced   | la fel de pronunțat |

#### Superlative

Relative superlative requires the use of the demostrative pronoun
`cel` which has 4 forms that differ by gender and number. The
pronoun has to agree with noun that the adjective describes.

| Number   | Masculine | Feminine |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| singular | cel       | cea      |
| plural   | cei       | cele     |

| Relative superlative type | English          | Romanian                |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| of superiority            | most pronounced  | cel mai pronunțat       |
| of inferiority            | least pronounced | cel mai puțin pronunțat |

Absolute superlative is straightforward; it is constructed by
prepending *foarte* (very).

* foarte pronunțat (very pronounced)
