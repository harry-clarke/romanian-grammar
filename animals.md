### Animal names for male, female, and baby

Romanian has specialized names for common animal types. The plural is formed from
either the male or the female form.

| English | Male     | Female    | Baby  | Plural    |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| horse   | **cal**  | iapă      | mânz  | cai       |

| cattle  | taur     | **vacă**  | vițel | vaci      |

### Animal groups

Like in English, some groups of animals have specialized names. Herbivores, for
example, will get the name *turmă* which is similar to the word *herd*.

* turmă de oi (flock of sheep)
* turmă de elefanți (elephant herd)
* turmă de vaci (cattle herd)

For birds one would usually use the word *stol*.

* stol de ciori (murder of crows)
* stol de porumbei (flock of pigeons)

Some groups, though, have custom names.

| English                | Romanian               |

| pack of wolves/dogs | haită de lupi  |
| beaver colony    | colonie de castori  |
