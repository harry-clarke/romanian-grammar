context, they will help you put everything together.

### Romanian alphabet

Romanian uses an extended Latin alphabet. Compared to the English alphabet, it
has the following five extra letters.

| Letter | English name                                    |
|:------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| Ă      | A-breve                                         |
| Â      | A-circumflex                                    |
| Î      | I-circumflex                                    |
| Ș      | S-comma (not to be confused with Ş - S-cedilla) |
| Ț      | T-comma (not to be confused with Ţ - T-cedilla) |

### Pronunciation

Apart from a few exceptions, Romanian consonants sound virtually identical to
their English counterparts. Vowels, on the other hand, have slightly different
pronunciations using a more relaxed/open mouth.

The following tables will aid you in pronouncing what are most probably the
most unfamiliar sounds to English speakers, yet they are by no means complete.
See [Romanian pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_alphabet)
for a more exhaustive explanation.

#### Vowels

| Sound | IPA phoneme | English example |
|:-----:|:-----------:|-----------------|
| A     | a           | f**a**ther      |
| Ă     | ə           | **a**bove       |
| Â / Î | ɨ           | ros**e**s       |
| I     | i           | cr**ee**d       |
| O     | o           | d**oo**r        |
| U     | u           | l**oo**m        |

#### Consonants

*C* and *G* followed by either *E* or *I* change their sounds.

| Sound   | IPA phoneme | English example |
|:-------:|:-----------:|-----------------|
| C       | k           | **c**ar         |
| Ce / Ci | tʃ          | **ch**alk       |
| Ge / Gi | ɨ           | **g**eneral     |
| J       | dʒ          | expo**s**ure    |
| Ș       | ʃ           | **sh**arp       |
| Ț       | ts          | pi**zz**a       |

### Â or Î

Although Â and Î sound precisely the same, Romanian use of both letters stems
from etymology. So, by using a simple rule to swap between the two, Romanian
has been able to retain some similarity with Latin, where most etymons use
A instead of Â and I instead of Î.

The rule between them is that Î is only used at the start and end of a word.
In the middle, you would use Â.

* **î**ncepe (to begin) - start
* hotăr**î** (to decide) - end
* mânca (to eat) - middle
* neînfricat (fearless) - here we use *î* because the word stems from *înfricat*
with the preposition *ne*

### Eu, ea, e, este

Although Romanian has exceptionally few pronunciation exception, there is one
which is noticeable from the very beginning. *Eu* (I/me), *el* (he/him), *ea*
(she/her), *ei* (they/them masc.), *ele* (they/them fem.), *e* (is), and *este*
(is) are all pronounced starting with /ie/ instead of simply /e/.

### Personal pronouns

Compared to English, Romanian's personal pronouns lack a precise translation
for *it*. When having a subject that you would normally use *it* for, you
can either use demonstrative pronouns (*acesta* (this masc.), *aceea* (that fem.)
etc.), or simply refrain from using a pronoun.

| English           | Romanian    |
|-------------------|-------------|
| I                 | Eu          |
| You               | Tu          |       
| He/She/It         | El/Ea/*N/A* |
| We                | Noi         |
| You (pl.)         | Voi         |
| They (masc./fem.) | Ei/Ele      |

### To be

In Romanian, the subject of any setence has to be in agreement with the verb
representing the action it is performing. This agreement is called **conjugation**
and comes with its own set of rules and exceptions. Below you will find the
conjugation table for *a fi* (to be).

| English               | Romanian        |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| I am                  | Eu **sunt**     |
| You are               | Tu **eşti**     |       
| He/She is             | El/Ea **este**  |
| We are                | Noi **suntem**  |
| You are (pl.)         | Voi **sunteţi** |
| They are (masc./fem.) | Ei/Ele **sunt** |
