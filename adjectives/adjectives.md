### Adjective inflection

Adjectives change their form in order to be in agreement with the noun they
are modifying. This is called inflection, and, in the case of Romanian,
it affects gender and number.

#### Variable form

Some adjectives like *greoi* (heavy), *vioi* (lively), *bălai* (blond) change
form only in the case of gender.

| Number   | Masculine | Feminine     |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Singular | greoi     | greo**aie**  |
| Plural   | greoi     | greo**aie**  |

Others like *mare* (big), *dulce* (sweet) change form only in the case of number.

| Number   | Masculine     | Feminine     |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Singular | mare          | mare         |
| Plural   | mar**i**      | mar**i**     |

Most of them, though, change have a different form in each case, like *bun* (good).

| Number   | Masculine     | Feminine     |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Singular | bun           | bun**ă**     |
| Plural   | bun**i**      | bun**e**     |

With some exceptions where the plural is the same like *roșu* (red), *drag* (dear).

| Number   | Masculine     | Feminine     |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Singular | drag          | drag**ă**    |
| Plural   | drag**i**     | drag**i**    |

| Number   | Masculine     | Feminine     |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Singular | roșu          | roși**e**    |
| Plural   | roși**i**     | roși**i**    |

While learning the language, you will notice that most adjectives roughly follow
the above endings with e a few exceptions, e.g. *-oaie* ending for feminines in the
first group, *-e* ending being used instead of *-ă* in the last group, *u* turning
into *i* in the case of *roșu* whenever a vowel comes after it, etc.

These rules and exceptions will come natural after a while, and, based of the form
of the adjective, you will be able to know all the forms only by recognizing the pattern.
But, for starters, you can look up any adjective in the [dictionary](https://dexonline.ro/),
and expand the section labeled **declinări** (declinations) to see all forms.

#### Invariable form

Some adjective have the same form in all possible use cases, but they few and some of
them are rarely used, like *gata* (ready), *cumsecade* (kind), *vivace* (vivacious).
