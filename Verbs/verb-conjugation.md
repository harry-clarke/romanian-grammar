# Verb Conjugation

Disclaimer : I am not a native Romanian. I have been studying it for 5 months, so if something is inaccurate a native can correct me.

I struggled with Romanian conjugation for the first few weeks - but trust me, you start doing it naturally once you progress. I will only explain present tense, as other tenses in Romanian are formed easy enough and you will master them if you know the present tense well.

The most important thing we should know about a verb to find out how it's conjugated is its infinitive form. In Romanian that is "a [infinitive]". For example: "a putea" (to be able to), "a vorbi" (to speak), "a vrea" (to want).

There are 4 types of verb groups in Romanian and they are distinguished by the ending of the infinitive form:

Type 1 - ends in just "-a". Examples: "a înota" (to swim), "a cânta" (to sing)

Type 2 - ends in "-ea". Examples: "a putea" (to be able to), "a vedea" (to see)

Type 3 - ends in "-e". Examples: "a merge" (to go/walk), "a plânge" (to cry)

Type 4 - ends in "i" or "î". Examples: "a găsi" (to find), "a urî" (to hate)

Okay! That's simple enough. Now, there are different conjugations for each group, but there are some subgroups of conjugation. Let's explore those:

For type 1:

We have two subgroups with different conjugation rules. Those are normal verbs and "-ez" verbs. For example:

We have "a înota" which for first-person singular is "eu înot" (I swim). That's a normal verb. However, we have verbs like "a picta" (to paint) which for first-person singular is "eu pictez" (I paint) and NOT "eu pict" as one might expect. Those are the only two subtypes in type 1 verbs and they have different conjugation rules. There is no easy way to identify which subtype it is by knowing just the infinitive, so you have to write down which one it is every time you learn a new verb.

For type 2:

Fortunately, there are no subtypes and there is just one type of conjugation for these verbs.

For type 3:

Just as for type 2 - just one type of conjugation.

For type 4:

Here we have some subtypes. We will break them down in two parts.

I. Verbs that end in "i".

Those are verbs like "a găsi"(to find), "a dormi" (to sleep). Just as in type 1 verbs, here we also have two ways to conjugate. Normal verbs and "-esc" verbs.

For "a dormi" the first-person singular is "eu dorm" (I sleep) - normal verb. For "a găsi", however, we have "eu găsesc"(I find) - so that's an "-esc" verb. Once again, there is no easy way to guess which one it's gonna be - so you have to remember that when learning the verb.

II. Verbs that end in "î"

Those are verbs like "a omorî" (to kill), "a urî" (to hate). Two conjugation types once again. Normal ones and "ăsc" verbs. As you can guess we simply have:

"a omorî"(to kill) - "eu omor" (I kill), but

"a urî" (to hate) - "eu urăsc" (I hate)

As you can guess - no easy way to guess which one it is gonna be, so just memorize for each verb.

Okay, that's all! Let's sum up!

Basically, considering all subtypes we have in total 8 different ways a verb can be conjugated. By knowing the infinitive you can narrow it down to one or two and then just memorize. But how does the actual conjugation work?

Basically, for each form you have to remove the suffix from the infinitive (that is, remove the "a" or "ea" or "e" or "i" or "î" at the end) and then add a different suffix depending on the situation. To find the suffixes you will have to add just open the Wikipedia page about Romanian verb conjugation:

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Romanian_verb_conjugation

Scroll down to "Moduri personale (Personal moods)" and look up the very first table for "Prezent (Present)". You will find the 8 types of conjugations I described and all the different suffixes you have to add in different cases.

You basically have to memorize this table. I did so in the first few days of learning Romanian and then with time it became very natural to me. Do not be scared, there are many patterns in it that will help you learn it quicker.

Sounds good, but is that all?

Unfortunately, just as any other language, Romanian has irregular verbs. This basically means it has "exceptions to the rules". There are some verbs whose conjugations you just have to memorize - there are no rules. They aren't that many so do not be afraid. I will give some examples:

The verb "a fi" (to be) is probably the most common one and it really doesn't follow any rules. Its conjugation is:

eu sunt - I am

tu ești - You are

el/ea este/e - He/She is

noi suntem - We are

voi sunteți - You are (plural)

ei/ele sunt - They are

Clearly, it has nothing to do with the infinitive! However, in other forms of the verb (different tenses/voices) the infinitive plays a role. So you just have to remember all those forms. One other example with the verb "a avea" (to have):

eu am - I have

tu ai - You have

el/ea are - He/She has

noi avem - We have

voi aveți - You have (plural)

ei/ele au - They have

There aren't too many irregular verbs and you will quickly catch the hang of it. Do not feel bad if you mistake conjugations sometimes - after 5 months and almost finished tree, I still do it all the time with irregular verbs. People will still understand you and it's all about practice.

Tips, tricks and observations to help you conjugate:

I will tell you some things that helped me when conjugating that may perhaps help you in the future. You should probably read them once you're more comfortable with the conjugations, as now they might just confuse you:

I. There are some patterns you will start seeing quickly. First-person singular usually has no suffix. Second-person singular mostly ends on "i". Third-person singular ends on "e" or "ă". First-person plural ends on "m". Second-person plural mostly ends on "ți".
Things like this will help you in identifying the way the verb is used when reading quicker. It also helps a lot in memorizing all the conjugations.

II. When you add an "i" suffix after "d" it often turns to "z":
"a vedea" - "tu vezi" (you see)

Similarly, when you add an "i" suffix after "n" it might just disappear, but not always:

"a spune" - "tu spui" (you say)

"a veni" - "tu vii" (you come) - the verb is irregular, but the "n" still disappears.

BUT "a turna" - "tu torni"

(seems to happen mostly when the "n" is surrounded by vowels)

And in general, not only in verbs, usually when you have an "i" after "s" it turns into "și" and if you have an "i" after "t" it turns into "ți". Not always, though.

III. An "u" in the beginning sometimes turns in "o" in conjugations:
"a putea" - "eu pot" - "tu poți" ..

"a turna" (to pour) - "eu torn" - "tu torni"

IV. Often if you have "o" in the second-to-last syllable and you conjugate with suffix "ă" or "e", then the "o" will change to "oa". For example
"a putea" - "el/ea poate"

"a turna" - "el/ea toarnă"

"a omorî" - "el/ea omoară"

V. First-person plural (noi - we) and second-person plural (voi - you[plural]) are very often (not always) regular even in irregular verbs:
"a avea" - "noi avem" - "voi aveți"

"a veni" - "noi venim" - "voi veniți"

This means that sometimes the u-o change (explained in III.) might disappear for those two cases only:

"a putea" - "noi putem" - "voi puteți"

"a turna" - "noi turnăm" - "voi turnați"

VI. For type 1 verbs the third-person singular (el/ea) and third-person plural (ei/ele) have the same form.
For all other types - first-person singular (eu) and third-person plural (ei/ele) have the same form.

Hope I helped and feel free to ask anything! I'm open to corrections from natives as well.
